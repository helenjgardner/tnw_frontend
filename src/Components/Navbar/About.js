                    About a third of all the food produced in the UK or imported into the country is wasted, according to scientists. A study by savings site VoucherCodes.co.uk has revealed that the average UK household throws away £355.68 worth of food every year, equating to a startling £9.7billion across the country annually.
                    Research collated in February 2019 shows that 65 per cent of UK adults admit to buying too much food that ends up being thrown away.
                    Some seven million tonnes of that waste (five million of which is perfectly edible) is created by households, with an equivalent carbon footprint of 22 million tonnes – a significant climate change issue. 
                    According to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the average family of four could save £70 per month by reducing their food waste.
